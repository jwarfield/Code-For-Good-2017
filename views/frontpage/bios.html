          <p class="bio-body">Greg is very much like a tree. Not in the sense that he's the strong silent type, but more in the sense that he's tall and has the personality of a tree.   Talking to Greg, it becomes clear that he knows a lot about biology- specifically a lot about what it's like being a tree.  Greg's dad is an apple farmer, which means he plants trees. In a way, you could say that Greg has more than just the two human siblings he has. He also has hundreds of fellow trees.  As iGEM moves forward trying to grow better plants, Greg moves forward trying to be a better tree. Truly leading his fellow vegetables by example.</p>

Coming in at 5.01 feet tall, Fion's voice carries all the way to Ashwin's ears on his towering 6'3" figure, but her arm isn't long enough for her hand to slap his face. When she's not busy arguing about Koko's or defending herself from compressed air, she studies for the MCAT because she's an aspiring pediatrician or anesthesiologist. While she does do research and is a human biology health and society major, she would much rather slurp away on spicy ramen and rice cakes. </p>

Add kittens to the batter (but make sure they aren't diseased). Cream together trips to LA and long road adventures. Sing Ed Sheeran at the top of your lungs at the batter ("thinking ouuuuuut louuuuuuud"). Sift out iGEM stress and chemE woes. Bake for 10 minutes in the oven, or until nicely browned. Top with kindness and encouragement. Serves 25, made for sharing with friends.</p>

Darren is the Co-PD despite being just a sexy and sassy freshman. When not male modeling, he spends his time leading and directing his fellow product development peers. Using his strong ECE and computer science background, Darren attractively contributed to the design and construction of OxyPonic’s electrical and web-related components. Further, he is known as the only human to keep up with Avisha at a party and live. The official Darren Tsai iGEM calendar is said to drop sometime in early 2018 with both professional and candid pics 😏. Mason Dacus has pre-ordered most of these calendars, but it is still worth trying to buy one.</p>

          <p class="bio-subtitle">Chemical Engineering '19</p>
          <p class="bio-body">Common Name: Sneha Kabaria<br>Scientific Name: Humanitas viribus<br><br>Etymology:<br><br>The binomial nomenclature Humanitas viribus was first coined by Cornell iGEM, a tribe situated in the upstate New York region. Records have suggested that Sneha is worshipped by members of the tribe, for witnessing Sneha is believed to imbue an individual with kindness, strength, and insight. Sneha is also sometimes known as “Policy and Practices Lead” among its people, reflecting her keystone presence in allowing Cornell iGEM to thrive.<br><br>Habitat:<br><br>Sneha exhibits unique migratory patterns, spending disproportionately lengthy periods of the year in the middle of nowhere to develop the next paradigm in cancer treatment as a chemical engineer. Occasionally, she retreats to the lush fields of New Jersey to recuperate from the cursed basement of Weill Hall, where incompatible restriction sites will ligate. Rumors have also claimed that Sneha can be seen in the forsaken halls of Baker Laboratory at 4 am, simultaneously studying for linear algebra, organic chemistry, and statistical mechanics, with a grace and ferocity that inspires awe and admiration.<br><br>Characteristics and Behaviors:<br><br>Sneha is characterized by a 72-hour circadian rhythm, rendering her capable of juggling 50 credits of coursework, handling two project teams, and having personal conversations with struggling friends until 3 in the morning. This is attributed to a unique metabolic pathway whereby caffeine is directly converted to ATP. In addition, as a master of all disciplines, Sneha once trained elementary school children to become experts biochemical engineering, many of whom have become important figures in the booming biotech industry of Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p class="bio-body">A true, one-of-a-kind iGEM legend, hailing from NYC, the one and only, the magnificent, Yi Fan Chen. He is the wise and undeniably helpful sage for all of the questions we have round the clock - from wet lab at 6 pm to organic chemistry at 12 am to please calm down it will be ok at 3 am. Some rumor he might have magical skills with what he can pull through in lab, and he has memorized no less than a million different molecular biology spells. His abilities are so great, that he has in the past been credited of lifiting the curse placed on the iGEM lab this past summer. Beyond his charms and brilliance though, he is more than willing to use his powers to help out any of the iGEM members, as he is no doubt an amazing friend. In a few years, Yi Fan will probably be on Forbes 30 Under 30 for science and simultaeneously winning the Noble Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Want to learn more about this famed, mystical figure? Lure him out of Weill with a bubble tea. You will be inspired by what you learn. Also, side note: don't cross him, he knows Akido and could probably kick your ass.
